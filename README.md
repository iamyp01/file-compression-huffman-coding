# file-compression-huffman-coding
It is a file compression program using Huffman Coding algorithm implemented in Python

## HUFFMAN CODING
> Replace the character in the data with their code values
> The code values assigned are bit sequences
> The different codes can have variable lengths for eg. - 'a' = 110, 'b' = 1011, ...
> The codes (bit sequences) are assigned such a way that no code occurs as a prefix of any other code
> like 110 above assigned for 'a' will not appear in front of any other code
> important to ensure there is no ambuiguity when we decode the data
> The characters which has high frequency should have smallest length code
> the above step is important to reduce overall size of encoded file
